# Lasermacht
A SFML/C++ game  
This is my first SFML/C++ game. I made it to learn C++ using SFML. You may find some bugs, but the code is highly commented so you can make changes easily  
The rules of the game  
1 There are 2 levels of difficulty: casual and difficult;
2 Use the mouse to move left/right and space to shoot;
3 From time to time hearts appear that give you +10 health and shields that make a temporarly "force field" and you are not damaged by the projectiles;
4 In the difficult mode the enemies are moving left and right and you need to hit them 3 times to destroy them;
5 The game ends when you hit an enemy, the score is less than -50 or your health is 0;
